# SwiftUISeries-Animations

This is my entry in the SwiftUI Series Animations challenge.

Happy to hear feedback about the animations I created. In no way are they perfect, but I had fun creating them and just wanted to play around a little bit. 

Here's a video showcasing them, and if you like, just clone the repo and run it for yourself.

Thanks to [Jordi](https://twitter.com/jordibruin) for putting this together. For some timings of the animations I used the [MotionScape app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motionscape-animation-studio/id1616840951) (that is open-source and all code [can be found here](https://github.com/GetStream/motionscape-app).
